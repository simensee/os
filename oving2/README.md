'An explanation is enough – fixing the problem can be quite a bit of work, depending on the approach…' - Michael Engel

**Description of the task**
As implemented, the web server has a significant security problem: it allows not only to access files under the www-path directory, but enables access to all files in the file system of the server that can be accessed by the user who started the webserver process.
Find a way to exploit this security problem. Then, find two different ways to prevent access to files outside of the webroot directory.
